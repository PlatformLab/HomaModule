This repo contains an implementation of the Homa transport protocol as a Linux kernel module.

- For details on the protocol, see the paper [Homa: A Receiver-Driven Low-Latency
  Transport Protocol Using Network Priorities](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3230564)
  which appeared in SIGCOMM in August, 2018.

- More information about this implementation and its performance are available in
  the paper [A Linux Kernel Implementation of the Homa Transport
  Protocol](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/atc21-ousterhout.pdf),
  which appeared in the USENIX Annual Technical Conference in July, 2021.

- As of August 2020, Homa has complete functionality for running real applications,
  and its tail latency is more than 10x better than TCP for all workloads I have
  measured (Homa's 99-th percentile latency is usually better than TCP's mean
  latency). Here is a list of the most significant functionality that is still
  missing:
  - Socket buffer memory management needs more work. Large numbers of large
    messages (hundreds of MB?) may cause buffer exhaustion and deadlock.
 
 - Please contact me if you have any problems using this repo; I'm happy to
   provide advice and support.

- Linux v5.4.3 is the primary development platform for this code. In the past
  it has run under 4.15.18;  other versions of Linux have not been tested and
  may require code changes (the upgrade from 4.15.18 to 5.4.3 took only about
  a day). If you get Homa working on other versions, please let me know and/or submit
  pull requests for required code changes.
  
- There now exists support for using Homa with gRPC: see the
  [GitHub repo](https://github.com/PlatformLab/grpc_homa).

- To build the module, type `make all`; then type `sudo insmod homa.ko` to install
  it, and `sudo rmmod homa` to remove an installed module.
  
- For best Homa performance, you should make the following configuration
  changes:
  - Enable priority queues in your switches, selected by the 3
    high-order bits of the DSCP field
    in IP packet headers. You can use `sysctl` to configure Homa's use of
    priorities (e.g., if you want it to use fewer than 8 levels). See the man
    page `homa.7` for more info.
  - Enable jumbo frames on your switches and on the Linux nodes.
  - Set the `rtt_bytes` parameter via `sysctl` to match your network's latency
    and bandwidth.
  - It may also be useful to set other Linux networking parameters. As one
    example, see the script  `cloudlab\bin\start_xl170`, which is what I
    use to configure my test nodes.
  
- A collection of man pages is available in the "man" subdirectory. The API for
  Homa is different from TCP sockets.

- The subdirectory "test" contains unit tests, which you can run by typing
  "make" in that subdirectory.
  
- The subdirectory "util" contains an assortment of utility programs that
  you may find useful in exercising Homa. Compile them by typing `make` in that
  subdirectory. Most notable is the `cperf` family of programs, which will
  run a variety of benchmarks on a cluster of nodes. The file cperf.py contains
  library functions for benchmarking, which are used by a variety of benchmarks
  with names starting with `cp_`.
  
 - Some additional tools you might find useful:
   - Homa collects various metrics about its behavior, such as the size
     distribution of incoming messages. You can access these through the
     file `/proc/net/homa_metrics`. The script `util/metrics.py` will
     collect metrics and print out all the numbers that have changed
     since its last run.
   - Homa exports a collection of configuration parameters through the
     sysctl mechanism. For details, see the man page `homa.7`.
     
## Significant recent improvements
- November 2021: changed semantics to at-most-once (servers can no
  longer see multiple instances of the same RPC).
- August 2021: added new versions of the Homa system calls that
  support iovecs; in addition, incoming messages can be read
  incrementally across several homa_recv calls.
- November 2020: upgraded to Linux 5.4.3.
- June 2020: implemented busy-waiting during homa_recv: shaves 2
  microseconds off latency.
- June 2020: several fixes to prevent RPCs from getting "stuck",
  where they never make progress.
- May 2020: got priorities working correctly using the DSCP field
  of IP headers.
- December 2019: first versions of cperf ("cluster performance")
  benchmark.
- December 2019 - June 2020: many improvements to the GRO mechanism,
  including better hashing and batching across RPCs; improves both
  throughput and latency.
- Fall 2019: many improvements to pacer, spread over a couple of months.
- November 6, 2019: reworked locking to use RPC-level locks instead of
  socket locks for most things (significantly reduces socket lock.
  contention). Many more refinements to this in subsequent commits.
- September 25, 2019: reworked timeout mechanism to eliminate over-hasty
  timeouts. Also, limit the rate at which RESENDs will be sent to an
  overloaded machine.
- August 1, 2019: GSO and GRO are now working.
- March 13, 2019: added support for shutdown kernel call, plus poll, select,
  and epoll. Homa now connects will all of the essential Linux plumbing.
- March 11, 2019: extended homa_recv API with new arguments: flags, id.
- February 16, 2019: added manual entries in the subdirectory "man".
- February 14, 2019: output queue throttling now seems to work (i.e., senders
  implement SRPT properly).
- November 6, 2019: timers and packet retransmission now work.
