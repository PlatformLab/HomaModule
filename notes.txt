Notes for Homa implementation in Linux:
---------------------------------------

* Machine status:
  rc71: up-to-date
  rc72: up-to-date
  rc73: up-to-date
  rc74: up-to-date
  rc75: up-to-date
  rc69: Henry's machine

* Possible performance improvements:
  * Pipeline data copying to/from user space with packet transmission/reception
  * Do the pacing from the sending thread?

* Things to do:
  * Improve timeout mechanism to work in the face of large numbers of
    outgoing messages:
    * Combine timeouts for a single target server.
    * Limit the number of simultaneous timeouts.
  * Figure out socket locking disciplines.
  * Unimplemented interface functions.
  * Learn about CONFIG_COMPAT and whether it needs to be supported in
    struct proto and struct proto_ops.
  * Learn about security stuff, and functions that need to be called for this.
  * Learn about memory management for sk_buffs: how many is it OK to have?
    * See tcp_out_of_memory.
  * Initially using simple lists for all tables; will need to replace with
    something more efficient.
    * homa_sock_find: now a hash table.
    * homa_find_server_rpc: list search
    * homa_find_client_rpc: list search
  * Eventually initialize homa.next_client_port to something random
  * Define a standard mechanism for returning errors:
    * Socket not supported on server (or server process ends while
      processing request).
    * Server timeout
  * Figure out what to do with byte order for 64-bit entities like RPC ids.
    There is no htonll, for some reason.
  * Is it safe to use non-locking skb queue functions?
  * Is the RCU usage for sockets safe? In particular, how long is it safe
    to use a homa_sock returned by homa_find_socket? Could it be deleted from
    underneath us? This question may no longer be relevant, given the
    implementation of homa_find_socket.
  * Can a packet input handler be invoked multiple times concurrently?
  * What is audit_sockaddr? Do I need to invoke it when I read sockaddrs
    from user space?
  * When a struct homa is destroyed, all of its sockets end up in an unsafe
    state in terms of their socktab links.
  * Is current locking safe if a socket gets deleted while a packet is
    being received?
  * Clean up ports and ips in unit_homa_incoming.c
  * Plug into Linux capability mechanism (man(7) capabilities)
  * Under some conditions, peer information will need to be invalidated.
    Use dst->obsolete? There is also a dst_check function.
  * Don't return any errors on sends?
  * Need to return errors to apps.
  * Homa-RAMCloud doesn't retransmit bytes if it transmitted other bytes
    recently; should HomaModule do the same? Otherwise, will retransmit
    for requests whose service time is just about equal to the resend timer.
  * Check tcp_transmit_skb to make sure we are doing everything we need to
    do with skbuffs (e.g., update sk_wmem_alloc?)
  * Add support for cgroups (e.g. to manage memory allocation)
  * Eliminate all uses of int: use s32 instead.
  * Can GRANTs be batched? Right now, if a string of packets is received
    back-to-back for a message, a separate grant gets sent for each packet.

* Questions for Linux experts:
  * If an interrupt arrives after a thread has been woken up to receive an
    incoming message, but before the kernel call returns, is it possible
    for the kernel call to return EINTR, such that the message isn't received
    and no one else has woken up to handle it?
  * OK to call kmalloc at interrupt level?
    Yes, but must specify GFP_ATOMIC as argument, not GFP_KERNEL; the operation
    will not sleep, which means it could fail more easily.
  * Is it OK to retain struct dst_entry pointers for a long time? Can they
    ever become obsolete (e.g. because routes change)?
  * Can flows and struct_dst's be shared across sockets? What information
    must be considered to make these things truly safe for sharing (e.g.
    source network port?)?
  * Source addresses for things like creating flows: can't just use a single
    value for this host? Could be different values at different times?
  * How to lock between user-level and bottom-half code?
    * Must use a spin lock
    * Must invoked spin_lock_bh and spin_lock_bh, which disable interrupts
      as well as acquire the lock.
    * What's the difference between bh_lock_sock and bh_lock_sock_nested?
  * Is there a platform-independent way to read a high-frequency clock?
    * get_cycles appears to perform a RDTSC
    * cpu_khz holds the clock frequency
    * do_gettimeofday takes 750 cycles!
    * current_kernel_time takes 120 cycles
    * sched_clock returns ns, takes 70 cycles
    * jiffies variable, plus HZ variable:  HZ is 250
  * What is the purpose of skbuff clones? Appears that cloning is recommended
    to transmit packet while retaining copy for retransmission.
  * If there is an error in ip_queue_xmit, does it free the packet?
    * The answer appears to the "yes", and Homa contains code to check this
      and log if not.

* Notes on IP packet transmission and reception:
  * ip_queue_xmit -> ip_local_out -> dst_output
  * Ultimately, output is handled by skb_dst(skb)->output(net, sk, skb),
    which probably is ip_output
  * ip_output -> ip_finish_output -> ip_finish_output2 -> neigh_output?
  * Incoming packets:
    * Interrupt handlers pass packets to netif_rx
    * It queues them in a per-CPU softnet_data structure
    * RPS: Receive Packet Steering
    * On the destination core, __netif_receive_skb_core is eventually invoked?
    * ip_rcv eventually gets called to handle all incoming IP packets
    * ip_local_deliver_finish finally calls Homa

* Notes on skbuff usage:
  * skb->destructor: invoked when skbuff is freed.
  * sk->sk_wmem_alloc:
    * Keeps track of memory in write buffers that are being transmitted.
    * Prevents final socket cleanup
    * Has an extra increment of 1, set when socket allocated
      and removed in sk_free (so cleanup won't be done until socket
      has been freed)
  * sk->sk_write_space: invoked to signal that write space has become available
  * skb->truesize: total amount of memory required by this skbuff, including
    both the data block and the skbuff header.
  * sock_wmalloc: allocates new buffer for writing, limiting to sk->sk_sndbuf
    and charging against sk->sk_wm_alloc
  * sk->sk_sndbuf: Maximum about of write buffer space that this socket can
    consume
  * sk->sk_wmem_queued: "persistent queue size" (perhaps buffers that are
    queued but not yet ready to transmit?)
  * sk->sk_rmem_alloc: appears to count space in read buffers, but it isn't
    invoked automatically in the current Homa call structure.
  * skb_set_owner_r, sock_rfree: assist in managing sk_rmem_alloc
  * nr_free_buffer_pages: appears to return info about total available
    memory space, for autosizing buffer usage?
  * sysctl_wmem_default: default write buffer space per socket.
  * net.ipv4.tcp_mem[0]: if memory usage is below this, no pressure
                    [1]: start applying memory pressure at this level
                    [2]: maximum allowed memory usage
  * net.ipv4.sysctl_tcp_wmem[0]: minimum sk_sndbuf for a socket
                            [1]: default sk_sndbuf
                            [2]: maximum allowable sk_sndbuf
  * sk_memory_allocated_add, sk_memory_allocated_sub: keep track of memory
   allocated for socket.

* Leads still to follow for skbuff usage:
  * Read sock_def_write_space, track variables used to wait for write space,
    see how these are used.
  * What's the meaning of SOCK_USE_WRITE_QUEUE in sock_wfree?
  * Check out sock_alloc_send_pskb
  * Check out skb_head_from_pool: allocate faster from processor-specific pool?
  * Check out sk_forward_alloc
  * Check out tcp_under_memory_pressure
  * Check out sk_mem_charge

* How buffer memory can accumulate in Homa:
  * Incoming packets: messages not complete, or application doesn't read.
  * Outgoing packets: receiver doesn't grant to us.

* Possible remedies for memory congestion:
  * Delete incoming messages that aren't active
  * Delete incoming messages that application is ignoring
  * Delete outgoing messages that aren't getting grants
  * Stop receiving data from incoming messages (discard packets, send BUSY)
  * Don't accept outbound data: stall in write, or reject

* Notes on timers:
  * hrtimers execute at irq level, not softirq
  * Functions to tell what level is current: in_irq(), in_softirq(), in_task()

* Detailed switches from normal module builds:

* TCP socket close: socket_file_ops in socket.c (.release)
  -> sock_close -> sock_release -> proto_ops.release
  -> inet_release (af_inet.c) -> sk->sk_prot->close
  -> tcp_close (tcp.c)

* How to pair requests and responses?
  * Choice #1: extend addresses to include an RPC id:
    * On client send, destination address has an id of 0; kernel fills in
      correct id.
    * On receive, the source address includes the RPC id (both client and server)
    * On server send, destination address has a non-zero id (the one from
      the receive): this is used to pair the response with a particular request.
    Analysis:
    * The RPC ID doesn't exactly fit as part of addresses, though it is close.
    * Doesn't require a change in API.
    * Can the kernel modify the address passed to sendmsg? What if the
      application invokes write instead of sendmsg?
  * Choice #2: perform sends and receives with an ioctl that can be used
    to pass RPC ids.
    Analysis:
    * Results in what is effectively a new interface.
  * Choice #3: put the RPC Id in the message at the beginning. The client
    selects the id, not the kernel, but the kernel will interpret these
    ids both on sends and receives.
    Analysis:
    * Awkward interaction between client and kernel, with the kernel
      now interpreting what used to be just an uninterpreted blob of data.
    * Will probably result in more application code to read and write
      the ids; unclear that this can be hidden from app.
  * Choice #4: define a new higher-level application API; it won't matter
    what the underlying kernel calls are:
    homa_send(fd, address, msg) -> id
    homa_recv(fd, buffer) -> id, length, sender_address, is_request
    homa_invoke(fd, address, request, response) -> response_length
    homa_reply(fd, address, id, msg)

* Notes on managing network buffers:
  * tcp_sendmsg_locked (tcp.c) invokes sk_stream_alloc_skb, which returns 0
    if memory running short.  It this happens, it invokes sk_stream_wait_memory
  * tcp_stream_memory_free: its result indicates if there's enough memory for
    a stream to accept more data
  * Receiving packets (tcp_v4_rcv -> tcp_v4_do_rcv -> tcp_rcv_state_process
    in tcp_ipv4.c)
  * There is a variable tcp_memory_allocated, but I can't find where it
    is increased; unclear exactly what this variable means.
  * There is a variable tcp_memory_pressure, plus functions
    tcp_enter_memory_pressure and tcp_leave_memory_pressure. The variable
    appears to be modified only by those 2 functions.
    * Couldn't find any direct calls to tcp_enter_memory_pressure, but a
      pointer is stored in the struct proto.
    * That pointer is invoked from sk_stream_alloc_skb and
      sk_enter_memory_pressure.
    * sk_enter_memory_pressure is     invoked from sk_page_frag_refill and
      __sk_mem_raise_allocated.
    * __sk_mem_raise_allocated is invoked from __sk_mem_schedule
    * __sk_mem_schedule is invoked from sk_wmem_schedule and sk_rmem_schedule

* Waiting for input in TCP:
  * tcp_recvmsg (tcp.c) -> sk_wait_data (sock.c)
    * Waits for a packet to arrive in sk->sk_receive_queue (loops)
  * tcp_v4_rcv (tcp_ipv4.c) -> tcp_v4_do_rcv
    -> tcp_rcv_established  (tcp_input.c) -> sk->sk_data_ready
    -> sock_def_readable (sock.c)
    * Wakes up sk->sk_wq

* Waiting for input in UDP:
  * udp_recvmsg -> __skb_recv_udp -> __skb_wait_for_more_packets (datagram.c)
    * Sleeps process with no loop
  * udp_rcv -> __udp4_lib_rcv -> udp_queue_rcv_skb -> __udp_queue_rcv_skb
    -> __udp_enqueue_schedule_skb -> sk->sk_data_ready
    -> sock_def_readable (sock.c)
    * Wakes up sk->sk_wq

* Notes on waiting:
  * sk_data_ready function looks like it will do most of the work for waking
    up a sleeping process. sock_def_readable is the default implementation.

* On send:
  * Immediately copy message into sk_buffs.
  * Client assigns message id; it's the first 8 bytes of the message data.
  * Return before sending entire message.
  * Homa keeps track of outstanding requests (some limit per socket?).
  * If message fails, kernel must fabricate a response. Perhaps all
    responses start with an id and a status?

* Tables needed:
  * All Homa sockets
    * Used to assign new port numbers
    * Used to dispatch incoming packets
    * Need RCU or some other kind of locking?
  * Outgoing RPCs (for a socket?)
    * Used to find state for incoming packets
    * Used for cleanup operations (socket closure, cancellation, etc.)
    * Used for detecting timeouts
    * No locks needed: use existing socket lock
    * Or, have one table for all sockets?
  * Outgoing requests that haven't yet been transmitted:
    * For scheduling outbound traffic
    * Must be global?
  * Outgoing responses that haven't yet been transmitted:
    * For scheduling outbound traffic
    * Must be global?
  * Incoming RPCs:
    * Use to find state for incoming packets

* Miscellaneous information:
  * For raw sockets: "man 7 raw"
  * Per-cpu data structures: linux/percpu.h, percpu-defs.h

* API for applications
  * Ideally, sends are asynchronous:
    * The send returns before the message has been sent
    * Data has been copied out of application-level buffers, so
      buffers can be reused
  * Must associate requests and responses:
    * A response is different from a request.
    * Kernel may need to keep track of open requests, so that it
      can handle RESEND packets appropriately; what if application
      doesn't respond, and an infinite backlog of open requests
      builds up? Must limit the kernel state that accumulates.
    * Maybe application must be involved in RESENDs?
  * On receive, application must provide space for largest possible message
    * Or, receives must take 2 system calls, one to get the size and
      one to get the message.
  * Support a polling API for incoming messages?
    * Client provides buffer space in advance
    * Kernel fills in data as packets arrive
    * Client can poll memory to see when new messages arrive
    * This would minimize sk_buff usage in the kernel
    * Is there a way for the kernel to access client memory when
      the process isn't active?
    * Can buffer space get fragmented? For example, the first part of
      a long message arrives, but the rest doesn't; meanwhile, buffers
      fill up and wrap around.
  * On receive, avoid copies of large message bodies? E.g., deliver only
    header to the application, then it can come back later and request
    that the body be copied to a particular spot.
  * Provide a batching mechanism to avoid a kernel call for each message?

* What happens when a socket is closed?1G
  * socket.c:sock_close
    * socket.c:sock_release
      * proto_ops.release -> af_inet.c:inet_release)
      * af_inet.c:inet_release doesn't appear to do anything relevant to Homa
        * proto.close -> sock.c:sk_common_release?)
          * proto.unhash
          * sock_orphan
          * sock_put (decrements ref count, frees)

* What happens in a connect syscall (UDP)?
  * socket.c:sys_connect
    * proto_ops.connect -> af_inet.c:inet_dgram_connect
      * proto.connect -> datagram.c:ip4_datagram_connect
        * datagram.c: __ip4_datagram_connect

* What happens in a bind syscall (UDP)?
  * socket.c:sys_bind
    * proto_ops.bind -> afinet.c:inet_bind
      * proto.bind -> (not defined for UDP)
      * If no proto.bind handler, then a bunch of obscure -looking stuff
        happens.

* What happens in a sendmsg syscall (UDP)?
  * socket.c:sys_sendmsg
    * socket.c:__sys_sendmsg
      * socket.c:___sys_sendmsg
        * Copy to msghdr and control info to kernel space
        * socket.c:sock_sendmsg
          * socket.c:sock_sendmsg_nosec
          * proto_ops.sendmsg -> afinet.c:inet_sendmsg
            * Auto-bind socket, if not bound
            * proto.sendmsg -> udp.c:udp_sendmsg
              * Long method ...
              * ip_output.c:ip_make_skb
                * Seems to collect data for the datagram?
                * __ip_append_data
              * udp.c:udp_send_skb
                * Creates UDP header
                * ip_output.c:ip_send_skb
                  * ip_local_out
