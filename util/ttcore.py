"""
Scan the timetrace data in a log file; for records containing certain
substrings, compute statistics for how often those records occur on each
core.
Usage: ttcore.py [substring substring ...] [file]
Each substring argument selects a collection of entries in the timetrace;
each collection will be analyzed separately for core usage. If no substrings
are specified, a default collection will be used. File gives the name of the
timetrace file to use (stdin is used if no file is specified).
