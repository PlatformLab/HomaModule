.SH DESCRIPTION
The function
.BR homa_reply ()
transmits a response message using the Homa transport protocol.
The argument
.I sockfd
is the file descriptor of the sending socket; this must be a Homa socket.
The response is stored in a buffer pointed to by
.IR request .
With
.BR homa_reply
the response message is stored in a single contiguous buffer pointed to by
.IR response ,
and the argument 
.I resplen
gives the length of the message in bytes.
With
.BR homa_replyv
the response message consists of multiple disjoint chunks, specified
by
.I iovcnt
descriptors at
.IR iov .
In either case the total message length must not exceed
.BR HOMA_MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH .
The destination for the request is given by
.I dest_addr
and
.I addrlen .
The argument
.I id
is an identifier previously returned by 
.BR homa_recv (3);
along with
.IR dest_addr ,
it identifies the request for which this message is the response.
If no such request is active,
.B homa_reply
returns (successfully) without doing anything.
.PP
This function returns as soon as the response has been queued for
transmission.

.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, the return value is 0.
On error, \-1 is returned and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EAFNOSUPPORT
The address family specified by
.I dest_addr
is not supported by Homa.
.TP
.B EBADF
.I sockfd
is not a valid open file descriptor.
.TP
.B EFAULT
An invalid user space address was specified for an argument.
.TP
.B EINTR
A signal occurred before any data was transmitted; see
.BR signal (7).
.TP
.B EINVAL
The size of the response exceeded
.B HOMA_MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH, or
.I sockfd
was not a Homa socket.
.TP
.B ENOMEM
No memory available.
.TP
.B ESHUTDOWN
The socked has been disabled using
.BR shutdown (2).
