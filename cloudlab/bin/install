# This script installs all of the files needed to run Homa tests on one
# or more target machines; it also loads the Homa kernel module.
#
# Usage:
# install num_nodes [first]
#
# The "num_nodes" arguments indicates how many servers should be updated.
# The "first" argument is optional; it is an integer identifying the
# first node on which installation will occur (e.g. "install 4 2" means
# node-2 through node-5 will be updated. "first" defaults to 0.
# This script assumes that Homa has been built in ~/homaModule on the
# current machine (this includes both homa.ko and all of the binaries in util).
