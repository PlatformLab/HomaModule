# This script uses files on the current machine to update the kernel one
# or more other machines and reboot to those machines.
#
# Usage:
# update_linux num_nodes [first]
#
# The "num_nodes" arguments indicates how many nodes the command should
# be run on (starting at node-1). The "first" argument is optional; it is
# an integer identifying the first node on which installation will occur
# (e.g. "update_linux 4 2" means node-2 through node-5 will be updated).
# "first" defaults to 1.
