# This script uses files on the current machine to update the kernel one
# or more other machines and reboot to those machines.
#
# Usage:
# update_linux num_nodes [first]
#
# The "num_nodes" arguments indicates how many nodes the command should
# be run on (starting at node1). The "first" argument is optional; it is
# an integer identifying the first node on which installation will occur
# (e.g. "update_linux 4 2" means node2 through node5 will be updated).
# "first" defaults to 1.

v=`uname -r`
#v=5.17.7+
